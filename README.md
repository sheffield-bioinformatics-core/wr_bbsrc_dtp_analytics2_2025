# Analytics 2: Introduction to the command-line for Bioinformatics

## Course Content


This course offers an introduction to working with Linux. We will describe the Linux environment so that participants can start to utilize command-line tools and feel comfortable using a text-based way of interacting with a computer. We will also introduce the "Git" version control system, which is a very powerful tool to help us secure our code from data loss. Weâ€™ll cover the terminology, how you can use it for your own projects and then how you can use it to make collaboration on a project easy.

## Pre-requisites

No prior programming experience is required. Computers will be provided. You can bring your own laptop to the workshop if you wish but it will need a working wi-fi connection and you will have to let the tutor know in advance so a temporary York password can be created for you.

## Learning Outcomes

After this course you should be able to:

- Connect to a Unix / Linux system
- Navigate around a file system by issuing commands; rather than using a Desktop environment
- Move and copy files and directories within the Linux system
- Work with text files
- Run programs from the command-line
- Write short scripts to document an analysis
- Use version control (git) to track and document changes to a file
